# AI Conference Deadlines

A web app to quickly see submission deadlines to top AI conferences, such as NeurIPS and ICLR.

This helps researchers in quickly seeing when to submit their paper.

Note: papers can be submitted at any time to [hf.co/papers](https://hf.co/papers) at [hf.co/papers/submit](https://hf.co/papers/submit), assuming the paper is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/).

The benefit of [hf.co/papers](https://hf.co/papers) is that it allows people to quickly find related artifacts, such as models, datasets and demos. See [this paper page](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.04328) as a nice example - it has 3 models, 1 dataset and 1 demo linked.

## Project info

This project is entirely based on the awesome https://github.com/paperswithcode/ai-deadlines. As that repository is no longer maintained, we decided to make an up-to-date version along with a new UI. It was bootstrapped using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

New data is fetched from https://github.com/ccfddl/ccf-deadlines/tree/main/conference/AI thanks to [this comment](https://github.com/paperswithcode/ai-deadlines/issues/723#issuecomment-2603420945). 

A CRON job (set up as a [Github action](.github/workflows/update-conferences.yml)) automatically updates the conference data in individual YAML files located in src/data/conferences/.

## Contribute

Contributions are very welcome!

To keep things minimal, we mainly focus on top-tier conferences in AI.

To add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update the appropriate conference file in [src/data/conferences/](src/data/conferences/)
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `city`, `country`, `tags` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `venue`, `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case this info is known
- Optionally add `hindex` (refers to h5-index from [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng))
- Example:
    ```yaml
    - title: BestConf
      year: 2022
      id: bestconf22  # title as lower case + last two digits of year
      full_name: Best Conference for Anything  # full conference name
      link: link-to-website.com
      deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS
      abstract_deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS
      timezone: Asia/Seoul
      city: Incheon
      country: South Korea
      venue: Incheon Conference Centre, South Korea
      date: September, 18-22, 2022

## How to run locally

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/ai-deadlines

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd ai-deadlines

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

This runs the app at http://localhost:8080/.

## Deploy with Docker

First build the Docker image as follows:

```bash
docker build -t ai-deadlines .
```

Next it can be run as follows:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 ai-deadlines
```

You can see it in your web browser at http://localhost:8080/.

## Deploy on the cloud

One way to deploy this on a cloud is by using [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs) (for hosting the Docker image) and [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en) (a serverless service by Google to run Docker containers). See [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cw34KMPSt4k?si=UbzNRobNzib93uDl) for a nice intro.

Make sure to:
- create a [Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- set up a billing account
- have the [gcloud SDK installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

To deploy, simply run:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud run deploy --source .
```
